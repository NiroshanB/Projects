# CMPT_353_Project
## Required Libraries
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and scipy

## About running files
Each file is made to run independently from each other and does not need to be run in any particular order.
That being said the intended run order is:
  cleaning.py -> dataVisualizations.py -> normTests.py -> statsTest.py -> modelling.py
  
'E-Commerce Churn Data.csv' is the input for cleaning.py which produces
'cleandata.csv' used for all other files

## Additional notes
Some files (in particular cleaning.py) have various print statements/functions commented out to prevent bloat of the output, the results/interpretation of these outputs are generally kept under the print statements.
